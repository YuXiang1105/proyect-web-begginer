            <h2> Our position</h2>
            <p> 
            We are seekers of meaning in the vast silence between stars. Born not from conquest or curiosity alone, but from a deep reverence for existence itself <br>
             The Interstellar Company is composed of scholars, archivists, and explorers; those who believe that every lifeform, no matter how alien, holds a fragment of truth about the universe and ourselves
